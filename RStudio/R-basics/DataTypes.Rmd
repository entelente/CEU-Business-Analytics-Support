# Most important data types and corresponding operations in R

## Basic types
```{r basictypes}
# By default the type of number is double. It is called numeric sometimes.
typeof(12)
# For complex number the imaginary part is denoted by "i"
typeof(12+3i)
# A single character or any text : character
typeof("Some text")
# Logical variables can only two values: TRUE, FALSE or T, F as a short form
typeof(TRUE)
# Integers are mainly used as indexes
typeof(as.integer(12))
```

## Basic operations

### Numbers
```{r basicoperations}
# For numeric and integer all the mathematical operatons can be used
(1+2-3*4)/2
# Exp
5^2
# Square and n-th root
sqrt(25)
125^(1/3)
```

### Logical variables
```{r logicaloperations}
# AND : TRUE only if both of the values are TRUE
TRUE & TRUE
FALSE & TRUE
FALSE & FALSE
# OR : TRUE if at least one of the values are TRUE
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE
```

### Text (Character)
```{r textoperations}
# concatanation of text (or numbers), the default separator is a space
paste("I have", 3, "apples.")
# Using empty separator
paste("I have", 3, "apples.", sep = "")
# Using custom separator
paste("I have", 3, "apples.", sep = " giggity ")
# Replacing parts of text with something
sub("3", "5", "I have 3 apples and 3 bananas.")
# Sub replaces only the first occurance. To have a "global" substitution use gsub
gsub("3", "5", "I have 3 apples and 3 bananas.")
```
